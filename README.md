<p>Priting Code is a class taught by <a href="https://github.com/runemadsen">Rune Madsen</a> in NYU ITP.</p>
<p>The class's website is <a href="http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/">here.</a> In this course students explore the use of computational techniques to produce physical prints, focusing on the intersection between graphic design and code. Class time will be divided between exploring design topics like colors, grids and typefaces, and applying these towards computational topics like randomization, repetition, transformation and generative form.</p>
<p>Unfortuntely, I didn't get into the class due to over loaded population, I only finished the first-week's assignment before I was out of the class.</p>
<p>This class is interesting and I will do the rest assignment in my spare times.</p>
<p>My first assignment:</p>
