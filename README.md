<p>Priting Code is a class taught by <a href="https://github.com/runemadsen">Rune Madsen</a> in NYU ITP.</p>
<p>The class's website is <a href="http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/">here.</a></p>
<p>Unfortuntely, I didn't get into the class due to over loaded population, I only finished the first-week's assignment before I was out of the class.</p>
<p>This class is interesting and I will do the rest assignment in my spare times.</p>
